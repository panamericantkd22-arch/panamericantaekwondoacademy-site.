Files created in the folder: /mnt/data/panamerican_qr_package
- panamerican_links.html   -> Landing page HTML (ready to upload to any static host)
- panamerican_links_dataurl_qr.png  -> QR that encodes the page as a data:text/html;base64,... URL (if QR creation succeeded)

Notes:
1) The QR encodes the full HTML as a data URL. Some scanners/browsers open data URLs directly; others may not. If the QR doesn't open the page on some devices, follow the hosting steps below and then regenerate a QR that points to the hosted URL (recommended for widest compatibility).

2) Recommended hosting (fast & free):
   - GitHub Pages: create a repo, upload panamerican_links.html (and the logo file if you want), then enable Pages -> use the repository root. URL will be like: https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/panamerican_links.html
   - Netlify / Vercel: drag-and-drop the HTML file.
   - Any web host will work; once hosted, create a QR that points to the hosted URL (I can generate that QR for you if you paste the hosted URL).

3) If you want your logo embedded directly inside the landing HTML (so the QR works standalone and shows the logo), upload the logo image here or tell me to embed it and I'll regenerate a new HTML with base64-embedded logo (note that makes the data URL larger).

Troubleshooting:
- If your phone scanner shows the raw data URL instead of opening it, try copying the URL into the phone browser's address bar.
- To regenerate a standard URL QR (recommended): host panamerican_links.html, then tell me the hosted URL and I'll produce a clean QR that points to it.

QR generation success: False
QR generation error (if any):
